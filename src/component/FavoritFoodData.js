    info: 'Open a can of tuna and you’ll quickly see why it’s one of the top foods cats love. You don’t even have to get fancy with it. Just give them a few pieces and they’ll think you’re the best! You can make tuna cakes as well, but be careful with mayo since many cats don’t tolerate it as well as others. Also, avoid spicy kinds of tuna, and stick to the plain kind instead.'

    info:'Obviously, milk is a popular treat for cats, but they also love yogurt! Since it’s milk based, it offers that same pleasing punch of dairy milk, however yogurt’s probiotics can ease their digestion if they’re sensitive to lactose. Again, try to stick to plain yogurt and not artificially flavored ones for the healthiest kinds possible.'

    info: 'If you eat ham, chances are your cat might want a few bites too! I don’t suggest feeding them standard lunch meat ham since it’s high in additives and harmful nitrates that might hurt your cat. Instead, if you give it to them, it’s best to feed them fresh ham.'

    info:'My dogs love coconut oil, but so does my cat, surprisingly. This all around superfood really pleases just about anyone, from human to critter! The mood-boosting fats and ease of digestion of this oil are some of the reasons it is loved and tolerated by most anyone. It’s best to buy extra virgin if you want the healthiest kind of coconut oil for your kitty though, along with yourself!'

    info:'I hate to say it, but ice cream is another favorite food of cats. Obviously, this isn’t a healthy treat, but they really do love it. If you eat ice cream, pick an organic kind, or even better a coconut milk based kind. Let your kitty lick the bowl if you want, but don’t feed them an entire serving. They might get a little sick! '
